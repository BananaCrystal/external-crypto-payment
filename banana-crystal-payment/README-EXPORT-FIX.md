# Export Fix for banana-crystal-payment

This document explains the changes made to fix the export issue with the `PaymentForm` component in the banana-crystal-payment package.

## Issue

The original issue was that when importing the `PaymentForm` component like this:

```javascript
import { PaymentForm } from 'banana-crystal-payment';
```

It would return `undefined` when trying to use it, indicating that it was not being exported properly.

## Solution

The following changes were made to fix the issue:

1. **Updated package.json**:
   - Removed `"type": "module"` to use CommonJS as the default module system
   - Changed the module field to point to a UMD build instead of ESM

2. **Updated rollup.config.js**:
   - Converted from ESM to CommonJS syntax
   - Changed the output format for the module build to UMD instead of ESM
   - Set `exports: 'named'` to ensure named exports work correctly
   - Added webpack and babel compatibility options

3. **Rebuilt the package**:
   - The package was rebuilt with the new configuration

## Testing

The fix was tested with both CommonJS and ESM imports:

### CommonJS (Node.js)
```javascript
const { PaymentForm } = require('banana-crystal-payment');
console.log('PaymentForm:', PaymentForm); // [Function: PaymentForm]
```

### ESM (Modern JavaScript)
```javascript
import { PaymentForm } from 'banana-crystal-payment';
console.log('PaymentForm:', PaymentForm); // [Function: PaymentForm]
```

Both import methods now correctly return the `PaymentForm` component.

## Technical Details

The main issue was related to how the module was being bundled and exported. By using UMD format with named exports, we ensure compatibility with both CommonJS and ESM environments, as well as with bundlers like webpack and tools like babel.

The UMD format is a universal module definition that works in both browser and Node.js environments, making it ideal for libraries that need to be consumed in different JavaScript environments.
